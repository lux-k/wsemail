<h1>Installation Steps</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a name for your server. This name will be needed to obtain a certificate 
    for your server.</li>
  <li>Obtain a certificate for your server. This step will vary depending upon 
    what kind of CA infrastructure you choose to use. The following are two important 
    items to note while creating your certificate.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The CN must be the name of your server.</li>
    <li>The email address of the certificate must be postmaster@server.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Run the certificate tool from the Program Group. You may choose to install 
    the Penn Security Lab root, if you plan to communicate with our servers. The 
    important button to use is the "Install Server Cert" button, which will install 
    the certificate you created in step 2 in the correct place and set the permissions 
    on the key correctly. The recommended format for loading the cert is a PKCS12 
    (pfx) bundle, with or without a password.</li>
  <li>After you have completed the certificate setup, run the Configurator to 
    setup the configuration file the server will use to start. The on-screen instructions 
    should guide you through setting up the database server, picking a name, etc.</li>
  <li>Test that the server is correctly setup. You can do this by going to <a href="http://localhost/WSEmailServer/">http://localhost/WSEmailServer/</a>. 
    At the bottom of the page, a message will appear in either red of green informing 
    you of the status of the server.</li>
</ol>
